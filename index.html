                Hello! My name is Michael Brown. I am a student learning at trios college , currently residing in Ontario Canada. I have a passion for retro gaming and learning new things , and I am ALWAYS eager to learn new things.

In my free time, you can often find me gaming,learning on how a program works, exploring new places, or spending quality time with my friends and family.

I am excited to embark on this journey of learning HTML, CSS, and other aspects of web development. I believe that with dedication and perseverance, I can acquire the skills needed to create amazing websites and projects.

Feel free to reach out to me ! I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.

                My journey in the field of technology started during my younger days when I began exploring programming for car computers and
                building small projects. Over the years, I have grabbed an interest in more complex tasks
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from my technical pursuits, I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing games , and capturing moments through
                photography. I believe in the importance of maintaining a balance between work and life, and these activities help me
                rejuvenate and stay creative.
